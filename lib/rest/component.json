Configure a client once, and share it safely throughout your application.  Easily extend with interceptors that wrap the request and/or response, or MIME type converters for rich data formats.\n\n\nBuild Status\n------------\n\n<table>\n  <tr><td>Master</td><td><a href=\"http://travis-ci.org/cujojs/rest\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://secure.travis-ci.org/cujojs/rest.png?branch=master\" /></a></tr>\n  <tr><td>Development</td><td><a href=\"http://travis-ci.org/cujojs/rest\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://secure.travis-ci.org/cujojs/rest.png?branch=dev\" /></a></tr>\n</table>\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nUsing rest.js is easy.  The core clients provide limited functionality around the request and response lifecycle.  The request and response objects are normalized to support portability between different JavaScript environments.\n\nThe return value from a client is a promise that is resolved with the response when the remote request finishes.\n\nThe core client behavior can be augmented with [interceptors](docs/interceptors.md#interceptor-principals).  An interceptor wraps the client and transforms the request and response.  For example: an interceptor may authenticate a request, or reject the promise if an error is encountered.  Interceptors may be combined to create a client with the desired behavior.  A configured interceptor acts just like a client.  The core clients are basic, they only know the low level mechanics of making a request and parsing the response.  All other behavior is applied and configurated with interceptors.\n\nInterceptors are applied to a client by chaining.  To chain a client with an interceptor, call the `chain` function on the client providing the interceptor and optionally a configuration object.  A new client is returned containing the interceptor's behavior applied to the parent client.  It's important to note that the behavior of the original client is not modified, in order to use the new behavior, you must use the returned client.\n\n\n### Making a basic request: ###\n\n```javascript\nvar rest = require('rest');\n\nrest({ path: '/' }).then(function(response) {\n    console.log('response: ', response);\n});\n```\n\nIn this example, you can see that the request object is very simple, it just includes the path.  All of the attributes of a request are optional.\n\nThe response should look familiar as well, it contains all the fields you would expect, including the response headers (many clients ignore the headers).\n\n\n### Working with JSON: ###\n\nIf you paid attention when executing the previous example, you may have noticed that the response.entity is a string.  Often we work with more complex data types.  For this, rest.js supports a rich set of [MIME type conversions](docs/mime.md) with the [MIME Interceptor](docs/interceptors.md#module-rest/interceptor/mime).  The correct converter will automatically be chosen based on the `Content-Type` response header.  Custom converts can be registered for a MIME type, more on that later...\n\n```javascript\nvar rest, mime, client;\n\nrest = require('rest'),\nmime = require('rest/interceptor/mime');\n\nclient = rest.chain(mime);\nclient({ path: '/data.json' }).then(function(response) {\n    console.log('response: ', response);\n});\n```\n\nBefore an interceptor can be used, it needs to be configured.  In this case, we will accept the default configuration, and obtain a client.  Now when we see the response, the entity will be a JS object instead of a String.\n\n\n### Composing Interceptors: ###\n\n```javascript\nvar rest, mime, errorCode, client;\n\nrest = require('rest'),\nmime = require('rest/interceptor/mime');\nerrorCode = require('rest/interceptor/errorCode');\n\nclient = rest.chain(mime)\n             .chain(errorCode, { code: 500 });\nclient({ path: '/data.json' }).then(\n    function(response) {\n        console.log('response: ', response);\n    },\n    function(response) {\n        console.error('response error: ', response);\n    }\n);\n```\n\nIn this example, we take the client create by the [MIME Interceptor](docs/interceptors.md#module-rest/interceptor/mime), and wrap it with the [Error Code Interceptor](https://github.com/s2js/rest/blob/cujojs/docs/interceptors.md#module-rest/interceptor/errorCode).  The error code interceptor accepts a configuration object that indicates what status codes should be considered an error.  In this case we override the default value of <=400, to only reject with 500 or greater status code.\n\nSince the error code interceptor can reject the response promise, we also add a second handler function to receive the response for requests in error.\n\nClients can continue to be composed with interceptors as needed.  At any point the client as configured can be shared.  It is safe to share clients and allow other parts of your application to continue to compose other clients around the shared core.  Your client is protected from additional interceptors that other parts of the application may add.\n\n\n### Declarative Interceptor Composition: ###\n\nFirst class support is provided for [declaratively composing interceptors using wire.js](docs/wire.md).  wire.js is an dependency injection container; you specify how the parts of your application interrelate and wire takes care of the dirty work to make it so.\n\nLet's take the previous example and configure the client using a wire specification instead of imperative code.\n\n```javascript\n{\n\t...,\n\tclient: {\n\t\trest: [\n\t\t\t{ module: 'rest/interceptor/mime' },\n\t\t\t{ module: 'rest/interceptor/errorCode', config: { code: 500 } }\n\t\t]\n\t},\n\tplugins: [{ module: 'rest/wire' }]\n}\n\n```\n\nThere are a couple things to notice.  First is the 'plugins' section, by declaring the `rest/wire` module, the `rest` factory becomes available within the specification.  The second thing to notice is that we no longer need to individually `require()` interceptor modules; wire is smart enough to automatically fetch the modules.  The interceptors are then chained together in the order they are defined and provided with the corresponding config object, if it's defined.  The resulting client can then be injected into any other object using standard wire facilities.\n\n\n### Custom MIME Converters: ###\n\n```javascript\nvar registry = require('rest/mime/registry');\n\nregistry.register('application/vnd.com.example', {\n    read: function(str) {\n        var obj;\n        // do string to object conversions\n        return obj;\n    },\n    write: function(obj) {\n        var str;\n        // do object to string conversions\n        return str;\n    }\n});\n```\n\nRegistering a custom converter is a simple as calling the register function on the [mime registry](docs/mime.md#module-rest/mime/registry) with the type and converter.  A converter has just two methods: `read` and `write`.  Read converts a String to a more complex Object.  Write converts an Object back into a String to be sent to the server.  HTTP is fundamentally a text based protocol after all.\n\nBuilt in converters are available under `rest/mime/type/{type}`, as an example, JSON support is located at `rest/mime/type/application/json`.  You never need to know this as a consumer, but it's a good place to find examples.\n\n\nSupported Environments\n----------------------\n\nOur goal is to work in every major JavaScript environment; Node.js and major browsers are actively tested and supported.\n\nIf your preferred environment is not supported, please let us know. Some features may not be available in all environments.\n\nTested environments:\n- Node.js (0.8, 0.6, should work in 0.10)\n- Chrome (stable)\n- Firefox (stable, ESR, should work in earlier versions)\n- IE (6-10)\n- Safari (5, 6, iOS 4-6, should work in earlier versions)\n- Opera (11, 12, should work in earlier versions)\n\nSpecific browser test are provided by [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/cujojs/rest) and [Sauce Labs' Open Sauce Plan](https://saucelabs.com/opensource). You can see [specific browser test results](https://saucelabs.com/u/cujojs-rest), although odds are they do not reference this specific release/branch/commit.\n\n\nGetting Started\n---------------\n\nrest.js can be installed via [npm](https://npmjs.org/), [Bower](http://twitter.github.com/bower/), or from source.\n\nTo install without source:\n\n    $ npm install rest\n\nor\n\n    $ bower install rest\n\nFrom source:\n\n    $ npm install\n\nrest.js is designed to run in a browser environment, utilizing [AMD modules](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD), or within [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).  [curl.js](https://github.com/cujojs/curl) is highly recommended as an AMD loader, although any loader should work.\n\nAn ECMAScript 5 compatible environment is assumed.  Older browsers, ::cough:: IE, that do not support ES5 natively can be shimmed.  Any shim should work, although we've tested against cujo's [poly.js](https://github.com/cujojs/poly)\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nFull project documentation is available in the [docs directory](docs).\n\n\nRunning the Tests\n-----------------\n\nThe test suite can be run in two different modes: in node, or in a browser.  We use [npm](https://npmjs.org/) and [Buster.JS](http://busterjs.org/) as the test driver, buster is installed automatically with other dependencies.\n\nBefore running the test suite for the first time:\n\n    $ npm install\n\nTo run the suite in node:\n\n    $ npm test\n\nTo run the suite in a browser:\n\n    $ npm start\n    browse to http://localhost:8282/ in the browser(s) you wish to test.  It can take a few seconds to start.\n\n\nGet in Touch\n------------\n\nYou can find us on the [cujojs mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cujojs), or the #cujojs IRC channel on freenode.\n\nPlease report issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/cujojs/rest/issues).  Include a brief description of the error, information about the runtime (including shims) and any error messages.\n\nFeature requests are also welcome.\n\n\nContributors\n------------\n\n- Scott Andrews <andrewss@vmware.com>\n- Jeremy Grelle <jgrelle@vmware.com>\n\nPlease see CONTRIBUTING.md for details on how to contribute to this project.\n\n\nCopyright\n---------\n\nCopyright 2012-2013 the original author or authors\n\nrest.js is made available under the MIT license.
